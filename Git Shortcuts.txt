No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

$ ls //-> check the directory and find nothing bcz .git is hidden

$ ls -a //-> finding hidden file
./  ../  .git/

****imp to remember *****
1.if the folder is a git repo then all the nested are also git repo we don't have to make it again a git repo 
it will give some headace bcz git following git it bit confusing 
2. if by mistakly you did repo of nested git folder make sure delete it by first
$ ls -a find the hidden folder .git
then 
$ rm -rf .git

##### Commit #######
**********basic things before commit****
Git workflow 
work on stuff - make files, edit files , delete files etc.
Add changes - group specific changes together, in preparation of committing 
Commit - Commit everything that was previously added
******************************************
there are 3 road to add and commit 
first Working Directory => git add => Staging Area => git commit => Repository

after chages to the folder/Dirctory we can add it to the git like this

$ git <file1.txt> <file2.txt>

(
HP@DESKTOP-KB05TOA MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/Git and GitHub(Teminal code)/MYFirstNovel (master)
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        Chapter 1.txt
        Characters.txt
)

$ git add Chapter1.txt
$ git add Characters.txt

$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   Chapter1.txt
        new file:   Characters.txt
***** git commit *****
git commit messages should be added for good practice but also we can just commit by $ git commit 

so how to give message when commit here how 
$ git commit -m "my message"
