Committing Basics Exercise
--Create a new folder called Shopping => mkdir Shopping
Initialize a new git repo inside of the Shopping folder (make sure you're not already inside of a Git repo!) => cd /Shopping => git init

--Make a new file called yard.txt => touch yard.txt

--Make another new file called groceries.txt => touch groceries.txt

--Make a commit that includes both empty files.  The message should be "create yard and groceries lists" => git commit -m "create yard and groceries lists"

=> code . // it will open vs code 
--In the yard.txt file, add the following changes:
- 2 bags of potting soil
- 1 bag of worm castings
=>​after this =>git add yard.txt
=> git commit -m "add ingredients for tomato soup"

--In the groceries.txt file, add the following:
- 4 tomatoes
- 6 shallots
- 1 fennel bulb
​=>​after this =>git add groceries.txt
=> git commit -m "aadd items needed for garden box"

XX--Make a new commit, including ONLY the changes from the groceries.txt file.  The commit message should be "add ingredients for tomato soup" 

XX--Make a second commit including ONLY the changes to the yard.txt file.  It should have the commit message "add items needed for garden box"

--Next up, add the following line to the end of groceries.txt
- couple of seed potatos

In the yard.txt file, change the first line so that it says "3 bags of potting soil" instead of "2 bags of potting soil"
- 3 bags of potting soil
- 1 bag of worm castings
​git add .


Make a commit that includes the changes to BOTH files.  The message should read "add items needed to grow potatoes"
=> git commit -m "add items needed to grow potatoes"

Use a Git command to display a list of the commits. You should see 4!
=>git status
